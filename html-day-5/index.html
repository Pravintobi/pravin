            <h2>The Rebel Poet</h2>
            <p>Kazi Nazrul Islam, a prominent Bengali poet, writer, journalist, and musician, is the national poet of
                Bangladesh. He produced a vast collection of works encompassing poetry, music, novels, stories, and
                messages that explored themes of equality, justice, anti-imperialism, humanity, and rebellion against
                oppression, along with religious devotion.</p>

                <h2>Acclaimed Writer</h2>
                <p>Nazrul composed nearly 4,000 songs, widely known as Nazrul Geeti. However, at the age of 43, he
                    suffered from an illness that led to memory and voice loss. He was later diagnosed with Pick's
                    disease, which significantly affected his health and forced him into isolation. Nazrul spent several
                    years in Ranchi's psychiatric hospital. In 1972, his family moved him to Bangladesh at the
                    invitation of the government. He passed away on 29 August 1976.</p>
